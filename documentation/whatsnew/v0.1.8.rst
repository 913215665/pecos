.. _whatsnew_0180:

v0.1.8 (master)
------------------------

* Added properties to the PerformanceMonitoring object to return the following:

  * Boolean mask, ``pm.mask``.  Indicates data that failed a quality control test. This
    replaces the method ``get_test_results_mask``, API change.
  * Cleaned data, ``pm.cleaned_data``. Data that failed a quality control test are replaced by NaN.

* Added the ability to run quality control tests as individual functions.  
  These functions allow the user to use Pecos without creating a PerformanceMonitoring object.  
  Each function returns cleaned data, a boolean mask, and a summary of quality control
  test results.
* io and graphics functions were updated to use specific components of the 
  PerformanceMonitoring class (instead of requiring an instance of the class).
  This changes the API for
  ``write_monitoring_report``,
  ``write_dashboard``, and
  ``plot_test_results``. 
* Filenames are now an optional parameter in io and graphics functions, this changes the API for 
  ``write_metrics``, and 
  ``write_test_results``.
* Added Python 3.7 tests
* Updated examples, tests, and documentation
